                    <li>Keep it short. We recommend not having more than 20 slides for a reader to click through.</li>
                    <li>Pick stories that have a strong chronological narrative. It does not work well for stories that need to jump around in the timeline.</li>
                    <li>Write each event as a part of a larger narrative.</li>
                    <li>Include events that build up to major occurrences â€” not just the major events.</li>
