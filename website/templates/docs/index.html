Experts can use their JSON skills to <a href="json-format.html">create custom installations</a> while keeping TimelineJS's core functionality.</p>

        <h4>Tips & tricks</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Keep it short. We recommend not having more than 20 slides for a reader to click through.</li>
          <li>Pick stories that have a strong chronological narrative. It does not work well for stories that need to jump around in the timeline.</li>
          <li>Write each event as a part of a larger narrative.</li>
          <li>Include events that build up to major occurrences — not just the major events.</li>
