## Media Types

The [official documentation for available media types](https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/media-types.html) is now maintained on the main TimelineJS website.



### Extending Media Types
* Create a new class for the media type in `source/js/media/type`. It's easiest to duplicate an existing one and change the filename and classname.
* Add the new file to the code-kit compile list inside the main `TL.Timeline.js` file. Code-kit uses the following language to prepend the file to the compile `// @codekit-prepend "media/types/TL.Media.YourMediaTypeName.js";`
* Add a new object to the `media_types` array in `source/js/media/TL.MediaType.js`. Make sure to have the correct class name in `cls` and use `match_str` as a regex to help timeline figure out what type of media the given url is.
* If you want icons for the media to show up in the Timeline, then you will also need to add an icon class to `source/less/icons/Icons.less` that has the name `.tl-icon-yourmediatypename`.
